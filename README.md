# Domain Generation Algorithm (DGA) Detection
The objective of this project is to experiment and select the best machine learning model to predict the domain names that are generated from DGAs and prevent the plausible cyber-attack.

Refer to the "Steps to run the DGA application" pdf to run the DGA web application.	

Following are the steps to setup and run the "DGA Detection using Machine Learning.ipynb" notebook:

1. Launch the Jupyter Notebook Application.
2. In the Notebook Dashboard navigate to find the notebook: clicking on its name will open it in a new browser tab.
3. You can run the notebook document step-by-step (one cell a time) by pressing shift + enter.
4. You can run the whole notebook in a single step by clicking on the menu Cell -> Run All.

Note:
1. This code takes approximately 3 hours to run on a windows machine
2. The additional packages used in this code file must be installed explicitly using "pip" if they are not already installed.
